# Knee-osteoporosis-disease
This project focuses on the automatic classification of knee osteoporosis disease from X-ray images using transfer learning with the ResNet-50 architecture. The goal is to assist early detection and diagnosis of osteoporosis by leveraging deep learning techniques to differentiate between normal and osteoporotic knee conditions.
